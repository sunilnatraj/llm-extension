### NB: Multiple OpenRouter instances can be created using 
different models while utilizing the same API key. This can be achieved by modifying the instance label (e.g. OpenRouter-DeepSeek) and specifying the desired model name (e.g., deepseek/deepseek-v3-base:free). Other configuration parameters may be adjusted as required or retained with their existing values.
